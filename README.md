## Project Description

This project introduces a flask-based web application designed for the summarizzation of complex PDF documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The application leverages machine learning models to parse, interpret, and condense extensive textual data, aiming for high-precision summaries. Some Challenges include extracting relevant information from unstructured text and condensing it without losing essential meaning.
